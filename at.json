However, his soft spot-kick was saved by Bolivia's goalkeeper, Guillermo Viscarra, leaving the scoreline goalless.Brazil eventually took the lead seven minutes later when Rodrygo reacted swiftly to slot home after Raphinha's shot was parried by Viscarra.After the break, Brazil doubled their lead as Raphinha's low shot, deflected slightly, found the bottom corner of the net.Neymar played a role in Brazil's third goal with a clever chipped pass that Bruno Guimaraes flicked into the path of Rodrygo, who confidently scored.Then came Neymar's historic moment as he capitalized on a loose ball in the box and tucked away his 78th goal in his 125th appearance for Brazil, raising his hands and gaze to the sky.Bolivia managed to pull one back when Victor Abrego broke through a disorganized Brazil defense and fired an unstoppable shot past Ederson.But Neymar wasn't done yet. In stoppage time, he connected with a low ball from Raphinha to extend his record tally and cap off a memorable night for the forward.The 31-year-old, who recently made a move from Paris Saint-Germain to Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal, now stands alone as Brazil's all-time top scorer, surpassing the legendary Pele, who scored 77 goals for Brazil between 1957 and 1971. Pele passed away in December at the age of 82.This victory marked an ideal start for Brazil's new coach, Fernando Diniz, who took over from the previous coach, Tite, following Brazil's World Cup quarter-final exit last year.In another match on Friday, under the guidance of new coach Marcelo Bielsa, Uruguay defeated Chile 3-1. Bielsa chose a youthful lineup, omitting veteran strikers Edinson Cavani and Luis Suarez. The move paid off, with Nicolas de la Cruz scoring twice for Uruguay.De la Cruz opened the scoring with a superb left-foot strike, and Federico Valverde doubled the lead just before halftime. De la Cruz completed his brace in the 71st minute after a swift left-sided break.Chile managed to pull a goal back through Arturo Vidal three minutes later, following a Diego Valdes header that hit the bar.The qualification process for the 2026 World Cup, expanded to 48 teams and hosted in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, offers two additional spots for South America, with six teams securing direct qualification and the seventh heading to an intercontinental playoff.On Thursday, Argentina defeated Ecuador 1-0 with a goal from Lionel Messi, while Peru played to a 0-0 draw against Paraguay, and Colombia secured a 1-0 victory over Venezuela in the opening matches of the qualifiers.","source_domain":"worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev","text":null,"title":"Neymar breaks Pele's record as Brazil crush Bolivia 5-1","title_page":null,"title_rss":null,"url":"https://worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev/?url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/neymar-breaks-peles-record-as-brazil-crush-bolivia-5-1/articleshow/103525079.cms"},{"authors":[],"date_download":"2023-09-09 06:10:34","date_modify":"None","date_publish":"None","description":"Salman Khan would have been surely shocked if he learned that he literally drove a wedge in someone's married life - and that too, virtually!

According to a local official, the majority of the fatalities occurred in remote mountainous regions that presented significant challenges for rescue efforts due to their difficult accessibility.The earthquake resulted in significant damage to buildings in major cities and caused panic among residents. People rushed into the streets and alleyways, from the capital city Rabat to Marrakech , which is the country's most popular tourist destination.Local media reported that numerous buildings had sustained damage, and there were concerns that dozens of people might have lost their lives.Montasir Itri, a resident of the mountain village of Asni near the epicentre, said most houses there were damaged. \"Our neighbours are under the rubble and people are working hard to rescue them using available means in the village,\" he said.Morccan citizens shared videos showing the aftermath of the earthquake, with buildings reduced to rubble and dust. Parts of the iconic red walls surrounding Marrakech's historic old city, a UNESCO World Heritage site, were also damaged. Videos from tourists and locals depicted scenes of people evacuating restaurants and establishments, with the sound of loud club music in the background.In the wake of such earthquakes, information regarding the extent of damage and any potential casualties often takes time to emerge, especially when the tremor occurs during the night.Rather than returning to their homes in concrete buildings, men, women, and children opted to remain in the streets, fearful of aftershocks and further tremors that could put their homes at risk.The US Geological Survey initially reported a preliminary magnitude of 6.8 for the earthquake, which occurred at 11:11pm (2211 GMT) and lasted for several seconds. Morocco's National Seismic Monitoring and Alert Network, on the other hand, measured it at 7 on the Richter scale. The US agency also noted a magnitude-4.9 aftershock 19 minutes later. Discrepancies in early measurements are common, but either reading would make this earthquake one of the strongest in Morocco in recent years. Although earthquakes are relatively uncommon in North Africa, a magnitude 5.8 tremor near Agadir in 1960 resulted in thousands of fatalities.The earthquake's epicenter was located high in the Atlas Mountains, approximately 70 kilometers (43.5 miles) south of Marrakech. It was also close to Toubkal, North Africa's highest peak, and Oukaimeden, a popular Moroccan ski resort. The USGS reported that the epicenter was 18 kilometers (11 miles) beneath the Earth's surface, while Morocco's seismic agency estimated it to be 8 kilometers (5 miles) deep.","source_domain":"worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev","text":null,"title":"Earthquake in Morocco kills at least 296 people, inflicts damage from mountain villages to historic Marrakech","title_page":null,"title_rss":null,"url":"https://worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev/?url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/earthquake-in-morocco-kills-at-least-296-people-inflicts-damage-from-mountain-villages-to-historic-marrakech/articleshow/103523171.cms"},{"authors":[],"date_download":"2023-09-09 06:10:36","date_modify":"None","date_publish":"None","description":"Tennis News: Indian tennis player Rohan Bopanna, at 43 years old, has become the oldest Grand Slam finalist of the Open Era.

Happily.When Bopanna and Matthew Ebden , the US Open 's sixth seeds, moved past the French pair of Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut in the semifinals, the Indian became the oldest Grand Slam finalist of the Open Era.At 43 years and 6 months, he beat Daniel Nestor 's record by three months. Earlier this year, when Bopanna and Ebden claimed the Indian Wells title, the 6ft 4' Kodava became the oldest ever ATP Masters winner.\"Nestor sent me a kind message,\" Bopanna deadpanned. \"Not really!\" he guffawed seconds later.\"As an athlete, the idea is to go out there, play well and win matches, these records keep happening, and it is fantastic to be part of it along the way,\" he said, hastening to add, \"If you have played at a high level for a long time, this is possible.\"Bopanna and Ebden , who lost in the first round of the Australian Open and Roland Garros , made the semifinals at Wimbledon .Ebden, who was born in Durban, South Africa, moved with his family to Australia when he was 12. The 35-year-old was ranked 39 in singles in 2018. \"At the end of my singles career I thought I now have a doubles career for another five years, I am there at 40,\" Ebden said, patting his partner on the back. \"Bops is pushing for more, sky's the limit really.\"\"I'm learning from Bops on the longevity thing, the way he approaches the season, life in general,\" the Aussie said. \"He finds a good balance and at the end of the day he's happy to switch off, not take life, yourself or things too seriously. This is a tough sport, our schedule is 11-months a year, hundreds of flights, matches, physical, mental\u2026 That (attitude) is rubbing off on me.\"When they decided to play together at the end of last season, Ebden had a question for the Indian. \"He wanted to know if I was committed to playing the whole season,\" Bopanna said.","source_domain":"worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev","text":null,"title":"US Open: For Rohan Bopanna, the name of the game is longevity","title_page":null,"title_rss":null,"url":"https://worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev/?url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/us-open/us-open-for-rohan-bopanna-the-name-of-the-game-is-longevity/articleshow/103523130.cms"},{"authors":[],"date_download":"2023-09-09 06:10:36","date_modify":"None","date_publish":"None","description":"India News: When the deal with BJP is inked, JD(S) will be an important addition to the NDA fold from the south.

This differs from the four mentioned by BSY.Sources said the two parties had planned to formally announce their tie-up on September 13 after the conclusion of the G20 summit, but BSY, who is also a BJP parliamentary board member, let the cat out of the bag before the official declaration.After announcing that BJP and JD(S) will fight the 2024 Lok Sabha polls in Karnataka together, ex-CM and BJP veteran BS Yediyurappa predicted the alliance will win 25-26 out of 28 seats in the state. Former BJP CM Basavaraj Bommai claimed the tie-up will change the state\u2019s political dynamics.In reaction, the state Congress was quick to take adig at JD(S), questioning the party\u2019s secular ideology.Deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar said: \u201cIt\u2019s about their [JD(S)] survival. But I don\u2019t know how their ideology works. Gowda had earlier said that he would not go (with BJP) at any cost. They have built a party based on a certain ideology. I don\u2019t know what will happen to their party and MLAs. I wish them all the best.\u201dExuding confidence about Congress\u2019 prospects in the elections, chief minister Siddaramaiah said: \u201cWe are not bothered about who will have ties with whom. We will seek votes from the people, and we are confident that we will win more seats.\u201dJD(S) functionaries, meanwhile, were more tight-lipped about the alliance, saying talks were still in their initial stage and nothing has been finalised.Commenting on the latest developments, former minister and JD(S) core committee head GT Devegowda said: \u201cWhat we got to know from Deve Gowdaji (former prime minister and party patriarch) himself is that they had only discussed the alliance, but nothing had been finalised. Such things must be dis cussed with the local leaders before coming to a decision as this is crucial for the success of the alliance.\u201dAccording to sources, although BJP agreed to spare four seats, JD(S) is bargaining hard for five: Hassan, Mandya, Tumakuru, Chikkaballapur and Kolar \u2014 all considered as the party\u2019s stronghold in the Old Mysuru region. Of these, JD(S) currently holds only Hassan, while the rest are held by BJP.Of the five seats JD(S) is believed to be insisting on, Mandya is the most contentious, as it is currently represented by independent Sumalatha, who had supported BJP. The party has already promised to field her from Mandya in 2024, but if the seat goes to JD(S), BJP may have to find another constituency for Sumalatha and in all probability, that alternative seat will be Bengaluru North, which is currently represented by former union minister DV Sadanand Gowda.","source_domain":"worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev","text":null,"title":"BJP seals poll deal with JD(S) to checkmate Congress in Karnataka","title_page":null,"title_rss":null,"url":"https://worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev/?url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bjp-seals-poll-deal-with-jds-to-checkmate-congress-in-karnataka/articleshow/103519821.cms"},{"authors":["Tnn"],"date_download":"2023-09-09 06:10:37","date_modify":"None","date_publish":"None","description":"India News: NEW DELHI: Buoyed by statements of support from the US and European Union, India and other G20 members were making a last-gasp effort to stitch togeth.","filename":"https%3A%2F%2Fworker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Ftimesofindia.indiatimes.com%2Findia%2Fglobal-leaders-are-here-but-where-are-they-on-ukraine%2Farticleshow%2F103519473.cms.json","graphId":"103519473.cms","image_url":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103519497,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-31580,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg","language":"en","localpath":null,"maintext":"NEW DELHI: Buoyed by statements of support from the US and European Union, India and other G20 members were making a last-gasp effort to stitch together a consensus over a communique to be adopted at the end of the Summit on Sunday, but the prospect of success remained uncertain.US NSA Jake Sullivan called for a spirit of compromise, which indicated a willingness for \"give-and-take\".European Council president Charles Michel also supported India's efforts to negotiate the differences over the language to be used while referring to the war in Ukraine , the issue having cleaved the grouping apart with China opposing the West's push for a condemnation of Russia for attacking Ukraine.While China denied the allegation of the US and the UK that it was delaying agreement on several issues, and said it would cooperate with others to secure a positive outcome, this was not being seen as a sign of willingness to compromise.

Biden's plan would match only a fraction of the Chinese investments in recent years but offers an alternative to Beijing's presence as an omnipresent and often unforgiving creditor.The president will have an important opportunity at the G20 meeting thanks to the decisions by President Xi Jinping of China and President Vladimir Putin of Russia to not attend. Biden will have room to present a case to a large group of important world leaders that they should align with the US on matters that include condemning Russia's war in Ukraine and curbing China's increasing assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific .The president plans to use the trip to shore up his relationship with the G20 host, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is using the economic-focused meeting to showcase the promise and potential of a juggernaut Indian economy. Biden, who hosted Modi for a state dinner in Washington in June, met with the PM shortly after his arrival in New Delhi on Friday.\"What PM Modi has demonstrated, and what the US is leaning into, is a leader who is willing to make bets on the future of the country,\" Nirav Patel, the chief executive of the Asia Group and deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the Pacific under President Barack Obama, said. \"The diplomatic as well as political stability that Modi enjoys allows this relationship to be more fruitful, and Biden has leaned into that.\"It remains to be seen how much of a partner Modi will ultimately be in Biden's broad efforts to counter China's rising aggression in the Indo-Pacific. India, which remained non-aligned during the Cold War, has likewise refused to join the American-led coalition aiding Ukraine in its war against invading Russian forces.Biden is also expected to hold separate meetings with several other leaders while he is in New Delhi. The White House has not identified which leaders he will meet with, but many are watching to see if Biden sits down with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia.

You have successfully cast your vote Login to view result\nMahesh Rangarajan is professor of history and environmental studies at Ashoka University. Speaking to Times Evoke, he discusses the evolution of climate justice \u2014 and the G20\u2019s potential:The G20 Summit brings the notion of environmental justice to the fore. The environment itself came onto the international agenda formally in 1972 at the Stockholm Conference . There were agreements before, such as the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963, motivated by concerns about what radioactive fallout would do to Earth. A notion of ecological safety and the future had begun. But the first global conference on the environment was in 1972.One of the strongest fissures then was between communist and capitalist countries or the Soviet and US-led blocs. The other was between the global North and South. Even though broad agreement emerged that the environment should be protected, there was disagreement on who\u2019d pick up the bill for this. Many developed countries said ecological problems were due to population, looking askance at Asia, Africa and Latin America.Developing countries argued the historical trajectory of imperialism and industrialisation was crucial and development could not be denied to latecomers \u2014 if environmental costs were to be controlled, technology and finance would have to be shared.In 1992, the UN Environment Conference met in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. By then, as much scientific climate work had come into public prominence, concerns about global warming had grown more central. Yet, divisions had also become sharper. It was clear now that greenhouse gases would be global in their impacts, encompassing everything from precipitation to oceans, crops to human health. But this was a post-Cold War world where the US saw economic growth as the major driver of solutions.A strong critique of this was made in \u2018Global Warming in an Unequal World\u2019, authored by Anil Agarwal and Sunita Narain, who used a car park analogy where a small number of people had taken a great deal of space and others couldn\u2019t even park a bicycle. They questioned how the global atmosphere could be apportioned now \u2014 would it be as per histories of growth, country size or per capita? Today, a lot has developed, including agreement on the principle of common but differentiated responsibility.: Indigenous groups work mines \u2014 but rarely benefit. Photo courtesy: iStockThe Sharm El-Sheikh COP in 2022 also saw concerns about global warming exceeding a safe margin. The issue of climate justice is now posed in a very stark form \u2014 all governments agree that something must be done. But the question remains \u2014 who will pick up the costs? One difference is that today, partly because of international cooperation stemming from globalisation, there is an idea of involving the private sector, mobilising capital and making technology accessible to more countries than possible earlier.Animals losing habitat also need environmental justice. Photo courtesy: iStockClimate justice is now also about those who would like modern development while minimising environmental harm \u2014 this applies to both developing and industrialised economies. The notion of climate justice is also important because different nations have different relationships to the world order which took shape after World War II. This gave great weightage to the countries which led the Allied coalition.But the world today is politically and economically different \u2014 hence, it must be environmentally different as well. The global ecological agenda needs to reflect shared concerns with different viewpoints. That includes costs, technology and choices about livelihoods and lifestyles. There is a recognition that humanity must reduce its collective environmental footprint without overburdening those who contributed the least to this.Hence, these choices must reflect the voices of the marginalised as well \u2014 this includes indigenous people and women. The Americas were transformed after the Colombian conquest over 500 years ago, a profoundly ecological and human disruption. Many countries have started recognising the rights of people displaced by this history, who are often termed First Nations. This also means ensuring their share in the proceeds of development and accommodating their worldview and practices which are extremely important ecologically.During the Morales period, Bolivia took steps to give indigenous peoples in the Amazon a share and say in forms of extraction. But nations like Brazil, Peru or Bolivia doing this remains the exception rather than the norm. Gender is even more complex. In much of the developing world, women don\u2019t have land rights, animal rights or tools of production like ploughs or fishing boats. A dilemma arises \u2014 when you choose renewable energy solutions, like taking land to grow wood for chips to be used instead of coal, what if this happens in woodlands which women depend on? That could worsen their lot. Ensuring the marginal a voice in sustainable decision-making is critical.There are ongoing instances of this \u2014 ecologist Madhav Gadgil\u2019s book \u2018A Walk Up The Hill\u2019 discusses parts of Maharashtra which have bamboo harvesting done by forest committees. These are generating revenue while renewing forest cover, water recharge, etc. The use of modern technology, like GPS, biodiversity registers, etc., show the opportunities for environmental renegotiations. Can we scale up these approaches? That is the question before us now.Then there are species which don\u2019t even speak human languages \u2014 however, their voices are also a part of climate justice. South Asia has large areas where terrestrial and marine ecologies are shared by people and other species. Anita Mani\u2019s book \u2018Women in the Wild\u2019 discusses research by Dr Vidya Athreya and others on leopards whose habitat often overlaps with people, coming into conflict when leopards prey on livestock, etc.But leopards and humans coexist in living landscapes \u2014 sugarcane fields, woodlands, even the great city of Mumbai. Concerns about how to live thus have brought together different communities \u2014 rich and poor, slum dwellers, residents of smart flats, all of whom are trying to learn to exist with leopards whose presence symbolises a healthy ecosystem. Divya Karnad, the geographer and ecologist, also shows how efforts to protect marine fisheries must involve local fishers. They know multiple species but need an income from fishing \u2014 it is possible to combine their knowledge to develop markets for bycatch, for instance.These are instances of people recognising that other species have value \u2014 of being a living creature and sometimes, also offering us a livelihood. The species conundrum and climate change are interrelated \u2014 keeping landscapes habitable for others is important for human well-being. The conversation on species must be informed by a knowledge of ecosystems. And there is the issue of justice. Human horizons are short \u2014 they extend to the next election cycle, a quarterly report, a five-year program.But the Atlantic bowhead whale lives 250 years. Environmental historian Bathsheba Demuth shows how its life is linked to communities which hunt it on both sides of the Bering Strait. How do you create a future which includes the Atlantic bowhead whale and native peoples in Russia and the US? Other countries can play a constructive role here. Cooperative discussions like the G20 can help participants include the species we share our planet with. Their well-being is intertwined with ours \u2014 and this place we call Earth.","source_domain":"worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev","text":null,"title":"\u2018From voices of the marginal to voiceless species, G20 can help to forge environmental justice\u2019","title_page":null,"title_rss":null,"url":"https://worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev/?url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/from-voices-of-the-marginal-to-voiceless-species-g20-can-help-to-forge-environmental-justice/articleshow/103518363.cms"},{"authors":[],"date_download":"2023-09-09 06:10:40","date_modify":"None","date_publish":"None","description":"India News: Armed militants struck for the fifth time in four months at Pallel town in Manipur's Tengnoupal district before dawn Friday, setting off retaliatory g.","filename":"https%3A%2F%2Fworker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Ftimesofindia.indiatimes.com%2Fcity%2Fimphal%2F2-killed-48-injured-in-armed-attack-in-manipur-town-5th-in-4-months%2Farticleshow%2F103520707.cms.json","graphId":"103520707.cms","image_url":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103521072,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-145496,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg","language":"en","localpath":null,"maintext":"'New trend of attackers now coming through Naga-inhabited areas'\nArmed militants struck for the fifth time in four months at Pallel town in Manipur's Tengnoupal district before dawn Friday, setting off retaliatory gunfire, arson and clashes between civilians and security forces in which two people died and 48 - including an Army officer - were wounded.Within hours of the violence, the administration evacuated 1,500-odd tribal women and children from this area with a mixed population, located 60km from Moreh on the India-Myanmar border .The first bullets were fired around 4am, when about 50 armed men in 15 vehicles coming from the Chandel side simultaneously attacked three villages - Molnoi, Kotlenphai and Munjang - along NH2, sources said. A man identified as Paokholen Haokip (32) was killed in one of the villages.Security forces arrived at the scene soon after, leading to a gunfight in which the officer was wounded.As security forces engaged armed militants who had attacked an area near Pallel town in Manipur on Friday, a crowd of villagers with women at the forefront scuffled with security forces in a bid to prevent reinforcements from reaching the zone where the armed group had struck, sources said.This led to the second death in the violence, when one Yengkhom Jiten (48) of Kakching died of a bullet injury to the head. Five among the 47 wounded were also struck by what security forces said were stray bullets fired in the air along with tear gas to disperse the mob.Around two dozen houses were burned down as the day progressed.

This time, they came in from the side of Thamlapokpi village, which is a Naga area,\" a source said.On August 18, suspected militants tortured and killed three Kuki villagers in Naga-dominant Ukhrul.

This was confirmed by UK PM Rishi Sunak too who said on his way to India that there was no joint statement yet because of objections raised by China on issues related to the Ukraine war and climate.Indian authorities, however, sounded upbeat about a New Delhi Declaration they said will be presented before the leaders for their final approval. Sullivan too said that the US was coming with immense goodwill towards producing a consensus. ``And in that, we bring a spirit of compromise to a lot of the different issues that are contentious so that we can find a text that everybody can live with,\u2019\u2019 said Sullivan, amid doubts as to whether the leaders will agree with the compromise text on the Ukraine war. He was speaking aboard Air Force One while accompanying President Joe Biden to India.There was no sign of any shift in China\u2019s position with Beijing, asked about the possibility of a joint declaration, reiterating that G20 needs to focus on its ``mandate\u2019\u2019 of enhancing macroeconomic policy coordination and boosting world economic growth. China continues to maintain G20 is not for addressing geopolitical issue.Significantly for India, the EU, which had rejected the language proposed by India to break the deadlock last week, said Friday it was helping India with its efforts to arrive at a consensus.\"We are supporting India\u2019s efforts.

Michel also said he didn\u2019t want to complicate the efforts for a consensus by talking 'tough' about the negotiations.That the negotiations on Ukraine and other contentious issues were far from over, despite the Indian optimism about the declaration, was also made obvious by Sunak who said the G20 had not reached a joint statement yet because of China\u2019s objections to issues related to Ukraine and climate. \"We are not there yet,\" Sunak told Bloomberg.However, asked about China\u2019s objections to G20 proposals , Kant said in a pre-summit briefing that India had been able to work with ``every single country\u2019\u2019 to reach the declaration. \"China is a multilateral player and they have their own perspectives.

Friday morning, his colleagues at TOI woke up to the news that he'd passed away, at the age of 68, in the middle of the night at his home in Mysuru. He was in daily touch with many of us through this week, and was drawing till the end - the laptop on his desk was open.At TOI, we were privileged to see his genius up close and personal. And it wasn't just his prolific output (such as his daily ' Just Like That ' cartoon) that he was valued for - Ajit was also central to every editorial discussion in our planning and preparation for big news days such as elections and the Union Budget. But for us, he was much more than that: He was a warm and wonderful human being, always appreciative and encouraging, bubbling with enthusiasm and humour (if you thought a cartoonist was supposed to be funny, he didn't disappoint).Countless colleagues from across TOI, young and senior, have their own stories to tell of Ajit - our designers and illustrators, for instance, will testify to how generous he was with his advice on, say, visualising a graphic-heavy page and at creating 'balance'.We will miss Ajit, for both his craft and his camaraderie. But he also leaves behind so many happy, smiley memories - most of us have our favourite 'Ninan moment' - and then there are of course his timeless cartoons!Creativity is an excellent thing to aspire to, most of us would agree. Self-help books, TED talks, corporate memoirs all talk up the value of creativity. It's no longer seen as the preserve of artists and geniuses, but as a wellspring we can all tap into, in all types of work, in engineering and management, in schooling and parenting and cooking, in living well.But what is creativity? Originality? Ingenuity? Divergent thinking? Far from being an eternal value, it is a foggy idea, a word that only came into popular use in 1950s America amid Cold War anxieties about conformity and falling behind in technology, says The Cult of Creativity: A Surprisingly Recent History by Samuel W Franklin.Of course humans have an urge to make things, and an appetite for novelty. But the idea of a trait called creativity is a recent invention. It replaced the older Romantic idea of the 'mad genius', which was both a gift and an affliction for those who had it. Creativity was a more democratic idea, accessible to all, and it suggests health and vitality.In post-war America, creativity was cast as the force of individualism, and it had both anti-communist and aspirational uses. If the Soviets were improving their technology by blueprint, Americans had ingenuity, they claimed. Psychologists, engineers and advertisers embraced for their own ends. Corporations introduced techniques like 'brainstorming', with 'freewheeling' sessions where good ideas could be generated by committee. In classrooms, creativity was taught as a kind of general ability, an overarching attitude.These were the decades when it was common to map political beliefs and systems onto personality types. Creativity was cast as an individual signature and a democratic value, the ability to live with some disorder in free societies, compared to the totalitarian systems that suppressed human impulse for the sake of stability and unity. But it was, and remains, a catchall term that people use for things they like, rather than any specific quality. The definitional ambiguity has helped it endure, and spread without question, the book explains.The uses of creativity have only multiplied in 'post-industrial' economies, which are supposedly no longer about making things in factories but having brilliant ideas. Today, as AI's abilities threaten to supplant human workers, there is even greater insistence on creativity, as the very thing that machines can't do. Creativity is packaged and sold as a product, as 'design thinking', for instance. Neuroscience and its applications promise to identify, quantify and maximise it.The book calls for a closer examination of what we label creativity, because there is no such pure spirit to be found. For instance, when it comes to accomplishing something, what matters is not some elusive inspiration but motivation, persistence, and the time and space to do it. Secondly, it might be helpful to look at the value of what's been created rather than its novelty. The cult of innovation and disruption has caused climate catastrophe and tech-driven chaos. Rather than glorifying change and newness, a more useful ethic could revolve around care and maintenance.We could value the work done by nurses, janitors, most engineers, garbage collectors and so on, mundane and essential work that keeps the world from falling apart. The opposite of destruction is perhaps not creation, but preservation, suggests the book.","source_domain":"worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev","text":null,"title":"TOI's master cartoonist who made India smile every morning","title_page":null,"title_rss":null,"url":"https://worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev/?url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tois-master-cartoonist-who-made-india-smile-every-morning-just-like-that/articleshow/103520175.cms"},{"authors":["Tnn"],"date_download":"2023-09-09 06:10:43","date_modify":"None","date_publish":"None","description":"India News: NEW DELHI: The drug menace on university campuses is rarely ever acknowledged by administrators.","filename":"https%3A%2F%2Fworker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Ftimesofindia.indiatimes.com%2Findia%2Fashoka-university-founder-flags-problem-of-drugs-on-campus%2Farticleshow%2F103521280.cms.json","graphId":"103521280.cms","image_url":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103521449,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1919881,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg","language":"en","localpath":null,"maintext":"NEW DELHI: The drug menace on university campuses is rarely ever acknowledged by administrators. Ashoka University co-founder Sanjeev Bikhchandani has created a flutter on social media by talking about the use of drugs by students at the university. Having raised questions on X, he told TOI that the student council at Ashoka must clarify their stand on substance abuse on the campus, referring primarily to marijuana or cannabis .He had earlier said on X that the student council, called the student government (which he described as an instance of 'title inflation' prevalent in the corporate sector), is \"under the impression that their mandate is to govern the university\", adding that they do not work on student activities and student life.\"I am disappointed...that the student government has had little to say or do about the problem of substance abuse by students at Ashoka. I think it would add a lot of value to Ashoka if the student government were to focus on this and assist the administration in its ongoing efforts to tackle this issue. I have heard stories of deliveries of drugs by drones and room delivery in the hostels. I hope these stories are apocryphal,\" he said on X.\"Anecdotally, I can tell that the problem of substance abuse is widespread and growing across educational campuses all over India, including in several of the IITs and IIMs. And Ashoka is not immune to it,\" he said, in an email response to TOI. \"After my tweet, I got several messages from parents of students in Ashoka and in other universities expressing gratitude for having raised this matter openly. It is the worst-kept secret in campuses across India and nobody was raising it openly for fear of reputation loss to the institution. However, if you don't acknowledge the problem, you will not be able to solve it - it is better to bite the bullet. Much of the drug consumption is limited to marijuana. However, there is some presence of harder drugs and that is more worrisome.\"Asked what the Ashoka administration was doing to deal with the problem, he said: \"The Ashoka management has been cognizant of this problem for the past several years and has been taking action in this area - from awareness to persuasion to warnings to inspections and disciplinary action (even expulsion in some cases). There is a graded matrix of nature of offences and actions to be taken. However, detection is difficult. Cooperation and support from the student government will help because they are in the hostels and they know what is going on.\"These observations are an offshoot of a post on X by Bikhchandani in which he shared an article from 'Newslaundry' and quoted what a student had said - \"No matter how much Ashoka boasts about its left-liberal values, but at the end of the day it is a capitalist institute...It cannot produce Bhagat Singhs or Umar Khalids.\"\"While I admire Bhagat Singh, as a parent, do I want my son to go to the gallows at the age of 22? I think most Ashoka parents will be relieved with this assessment of the university. Ashoka is boring - thank God,\" Bikhchandani quipped.He said that parents do not pay fees at Ashoka so that their wards can do 'aandolans' and underlined his view that Ashoka does not boast of left-liberal values. \"Some individuals at Ashoka might be. And they might want to paint all of Ashoka in that fashion because that is what they believe. Ashoka is merely a liberal arts and sciences university. It values openness and a spirit of inquiry,\" he said.Responding to this, a student body called Leher Ashoka, which describes itself on X as \"a liberal student political party\", said, \"Many courses at Ashoka teach students to critically think about the world, its institutions and status quo. Some students choose to apply their learning in practice, engaging in political activism.\"\"Mr Bikhchandani's scorn and dismissal of student activism is a huge disrespect to the rich culture of student politics India has seen. No university hoping to inculcate future leaders can do so by restricting political discourse to the classroom. He is right though that Ashoka isn't an ideological echo chamber. However, the very openness and spirit of inquiry that he speaks of is currently at threat due to him and the other founders being unable to protect academic freedom or provide answers for the same,\" added Leher Ashoka.","source_domain":"worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev","text":null,"title":"Ashoka University founder flags problem of drugs on campus","title_page":null,"title_rss":null,"url":"https://worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev/?url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ashoka-university-founder-flags-problem-of-drugs-on-campus/articleshow/103521280.cms"},{"authors":["Tnn"],"date_download":"2023-09-09 06:10:43","date_modify":"None","date_publish":"None","description":"India News: On a trip to Europe, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday said his exchange with European parliamentarians included informing them about the attacks","filename":"https%3A%2F%2Fworker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Ftimesofindia.indiatimes.com%2Findia%2Fattempt-to-change-the-nature-of-our-nation-rahul-in-europe%2Farticleshow%2F103522280.cms.json","graphId":"103522280.cms","image_url":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103522282,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-28484,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg","language":"en","localpath":null,"maintext":"NEW DELHI: On a trip to Europe, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday said his exchange with European parliamentarians included informing them about the attacks on India\u2019s democratic foundations by the groups in power, and \u201cthey appeared very concerned\u201d.At a press conference in Brussels, Rahul said he told the members of the European Parliament about the types of challenges India is facing \u2014 on the economic front and the general attacks on democratic institutions.\u201cThere is an attempt to change the nature of our country.

He had finished a runner-up with his Pakistani partner Aisam-ul-haq Qureshi way back in 2010, losing the title clash to the legendary Bryan brothers.Overall, it was third Grand Slam final for Bopanna, who won his first and only Major in 2017 when he lifted the French Open mixed doubles trophy with Canadian partner Gabriela Dabrowski.Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi are only two male tennis players from India to have won Grand Slam titles.Bopanna and Ebden got the start they wanted, breaking their rivals in the very first game. The Indian's ferocious forehand was at work. He blasted a winner on a feeble return to earn three breakpoints.Ram only helped them by fluffing an easy backhand volley on the first chance. Bopanna consolidated the lead with an easy hold.The sixth seeds had a chance to go up 3-0 but could not convert the breakpoint when the Briton served at 30-40. The defending champions survived a few anxious moments but eventually got on board after playing three deuce points in that third game.Ebden's volley winner on Salibury's return earned them another breakpoint and they sealed that when the Briton could pick up a half-volley.This put Bopanna and Ebden firmly in control of the contest as they were now leading the first set 5-2.The Australian came out to serve out the set and delivered. Ebden landed his serves exactly where he wanted to go up 40-0 and Ram hit his forehand return long on the first set point.Salisbury was feeling the heat. It was evident when he came out to serve in the second set.The Briton served two double faults and was down a breakpoint when Bopanna found a screaming backhand passing winner at 30-all, running on his left but eventually the third seeds managed to hold the third game to stay alive in the match.Soon it was Bopanna who was now struggling with his serve. He served a double fault and Ram's strategy of firing deep returns unsettled the Indian a bit and it was enough to steal that crucial break that put the holders 4-2 up.Having grown in confidence with that break of serve, Ram's serve got better and Sailsbury's ground strokes too improved along with movement on the court.Ram sealed the set with an ace, forcing a decider.Clearly, the momentum had shifted.To make it even tougher for himself Bopanna was down 0-40 in the opening game of the final set but saved all breakpoints by reeling off five straight points for a tough hold.Heart-stopping action followed in the fourth game when Salisbury staved off three breakpoints to stay on serve.With two teams raising the level of the tennis being played, intense action was witnessed. Bopanna served a double fault at 30-all in the fifth game to be down by another breakpoint.The Indian went for an all-out cross court forehand winner but missed the line by a very thin margin to hand a crucial break to the rival team that consolidated the break with an easy hold.Down 2-4 in the final set, Bopanna showed exemplary sportsman spirit and character when he himself conceded a point after a ball deflected off his right arm when his serving partner made a forehand return.It was considered a winner as the chair umpire could not notice the deflection but the Indian himself told the umpire that he was conceding the point. Ebden held the serve and so did Bopanna in the next game.Ram came out to serve for the championship and there was no twist in the tale.","source_domain":"worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev","text":null,"title":"Rohan Bopanna-Matthew Ebden pair suffers US Open heartbreak, loses in final","title_page":null,"title_rss":null,"url":"https://worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev/?url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/us-open/rohan-bopanna-matthew-ebden-pair-suffers-us-open-heartbreak-loses-in-final/articleshow/103518669.cms"},{"authors":["Timesofindia.Com"],"date_download":"2023-09-09 06:10:47","date_modify":"None","date_publish":"None","description":"The Assam Cabinet has recommended the withdrawal of the Disturbed Areas Act and Armed Forces Special Powers Act (Afspa) from the entire state, accordi","filename":"https%3A%2F%2Fworker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Ftimesofindia.indiatimes.com%2Findia%2Fassam-cabinet-recommends-centre-withdraw-afspa-from-entire-state%2Farticleshow%2F103517562.cms.json","graphId":"103517562.cms","image_url":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103517554,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-33134,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg","language":"en","localpath":null,"maintext":"NEW DELHI: The Assam Cabinet has made a recommendation to the Centre to withdraw the Disturbed Areas Act and Afspa from the entire state, chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Friday.The recommendation comes days after Sarma met Union home minister Amit Shah in New Delhi and pleaded for the complete withdrawal of the contentious Armed Forces Special Powers Act (Afspa) from the state.Sarma had said his government would take further steps based on the suggestions of the home minister.At present, the Act is in force in eight districts of the state - Tinsukia, Dibrugarh, Charaideo, Sivasagar, Jorhat, Golaghat, Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao - which have been tagged as \"disturbed areas\".

The question has been a hot topic of discussion, especially since his selection in the India squad for the ongoing Asia Cup and the upcoming World Cup.On Friday, Rahul addressed some of the doubts surrounding his wicketkeeping as he spent nearly 45 minutes behind the stumps during practice session.While Rahul has been displaying fluent batting form during match simulations and net sessions, his wicket-keeping skills have continued to be a big point of discussion.Rahul's intense keeping drill at nets might have also brightened his chance of getting included in India's playing 11 for the Super 4 match against Pakistan on Sunday.Rahul last played for India in an ODI match against Australia in Chennai in March this year.Going through various scenarios of a match was at the core of Rahul's training at the Premadasa Stadium on Friday.The training started with Rahul standing up to the stumps as two support staff members did the duties of batter and bowler, a simulation of keeping to spinners.Rahul was given a test on collecting the ball outside off-stump, and the 31-year-old also managed to crouch for the entire duration of training without much discomfort.It might have given the team management a vivid portend about Rahul's recovery from a niggle which was independent of the right thigh injury that mandated a surgery and rehabilitation.Rahul soon shifted his focus to collecting the ball down the leg-side as the support staff aimed his throws in that direction.Rahul aced the test without much difficulty, and glided down the leg to collect the balls.The drill followed an assessment to test his ability to affect stumpings, and later Kuldeep Yadav batted as Rahul's readiness to keep against a left-handed batter was also put under the test.The clear indications of his readiness notwithstanding, the team management will have to apply deep thoughts about giving Rahul a place in the 11.In the absence of Rahul, Ishan Kishan has been playing the wicket-keeper batter role.Kishan made four half-centuries in as many matches \u2013 3 against the West Indies and one against Pakistan, to impress all.The Jharkhand left-hander also showed heartening adaptability in this interim. Kishan batted in his preferred opening slot against the Windies.But the management asked him to bat at No. 5 against Pakistan in the Asia Cup league match, and Kishan produced a composed 81-ball 82.The management might be tempted to continue with Kishan but the return of Rahul might have started a change in thinking.In the past too one has seen players walking straight back into the 11 after recuperation, with the latest example being Shreyas Iyer.The Mumbaikar, who made a return to the India side during the match against Pakistan at Pallekele after a hiatus of 6 months, was allotted the No. 4 slot, his chosen position.Meanwhile, Sanju Samson, who was the travelling reserve, returned to India after Rahul joined the squad here.Pacer Jasprit Bumrah, who skipped the Asia Cup league match against Nepal to be with his wife for the birth of their first child, too has rejoined the squad, and sweated it out at the nets.","source_domain":"worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev","text":null,"title":"Asia Cup: KL Rahul keeps wickets at nets ahead of Pakistan clash","title_page":null,"title_rss":null,"url":"https://worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev/?url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/asia-cup/asia-cup-kl-rahul-keeps-wickets-at-nets-ahead-of-pakistan-clash/articleshow/103517522.cms"},{"authors":["Timesofindia.Com"],"date_download":"2023-09-09 06:10:49","date_modify":"None","date_publish":"None","description":"India News: NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday held bilateral talks with US President Joe Biden at his 7, Lok Kalyan Marg, residence in New Delhi, .","filename":"https%3A%2F%2Fworker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Ftimesofindia.indiatimes.com%2Findia%2Fpm-modi-to-hold-15-bilateral-meetings-over-3-days-top-developments%2Farticleshow%2F103514010.cms.json","graphId":"103514010.cms","image_url":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103516386,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-3607962,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg","language":"en","localpath":null,"maintext":"Here are the top developments through the day:\nMeeting very productive: PM Modi after talks with Biden\nBiden, PM Modi hold bilateral talks\nNeed to reform UNSC to reflect realities of today's world: Guterres\nNew path to human-centric development: PM Modi\nWorld leaders start arriving for G20 summit\n(With inputs from agencies)\nNEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday held bilateral talks with US President Joe Biden at his 7, Lok Kalyan Marg, residence in New Delhi, shortly after Biden's Air Force One landed in the Capital ahead of the weekend's G20 Summit .SEE ALSO: G20 Summit 2023 in Delhi Live Updates The Prime Minister's Office shared photos of the two leaders holding talks on \"a wide range of issues (that) will further deepen bond between India and the US\".After the leaders' bilateral meeting, the Prime Minister hosted a dinner for Biden.Earlier in the day, PM Modi held bilateral talks with his Mauritian counterpart Pravind Jugnauth and Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina.PM Modi is scheduled to hold at least 12 more bilateral meetings over the next two days on the sidelines of the G20 Leaders' Summit in New Delhi.On Saturday, PM Modi will hold bilateral meetings with leaders of the UK, Japan, Germany and Italy besides attending the G20 events.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters ahead of the meeting that the talks would show \"the breadth of the relationship between our countries\".A number of topics, including a deal for jet engines, procurement of predator drones, and collaboration on critical technologies like 5G and 6G networks, were likely discussed during the talks.After the G20, Biden is to visit Vietnam before returning to the United States later on Monday.United Nations chief Antonio Guterres on Friday described India as \"the country of the world\" and a \"very important\" partner in the multilateral system but said it is for the members and not him to decide on its UN Security Council membership.Addressing a press conference here ahead of the G20 Summit, he made a strong pitch for immediate reforms to UNSC and other multilateral institutions, as he asserted that the future of the world is multipolar but \"our multilateral institutions reflect a bygone age\".Asked whether it was time for India to become a member of the UNSC, he said, \"It is not for me to decide who would be in UNSC, it is for the members.\"\"But it is obvious that India is today the country of the world with the largest population and it is a very important partner in the multilateral system,\" he said.\"All I can say that I believe that we need reform in multilateral system to reflect today's world,\" Guterres added.He said the phrase of 'One Earth, One Family and One Future' adopted by India as G20 theme, inspired by the Mahaupanishad, finds profound resonance in today's world. \"If we are indeed one global family, today we resemble rather a dysfunctional one,\" he added.A day before the G20 Summit begins, PM Modi on Friday expressed confidence that it will chart a new path in the human-centric and inclusive development.Invoking Mahatma Gandhi, he said on X that it is important to emulate his mission of serving the underprivileged, the very last person in the queue, as he underlined India's great emphasis on a human-centric way of furthering progress.\"We seek to accelerate progress of SDGs, Green Development Pact for a Sustainable Future and strengthen Multilateral Institutions for the 21st Century. We attach immense priority to futuristic sectors such as technological transformation and digital public infrastructure. We will also collectively work to further gender equality, women empowerment and ensure world peace,\" he said.Rooted in our cultural ethos, India's G20 presidency theme, 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam - One Earth, One Family, One Future', deeply resonates with our world view that the whole world is one family, he said.Several world leaders, including US President Joe Biden, British PM Rishi Sunak, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina and UN Secretary General Antonia Guterres, arrived in New Delhi on Friday to attend the G20 summit, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying he looks forward to productive discussions with them over the next two days.The leaders were welcomed by traditional dance performances by various troupes and a smiling IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva danced to the beat of the music at the airport.Italian PM Giorgia Meloni and Hasina were received at the airport by Union Ministers Shobha Karandlaje and Darshana Jardosh respectively.Sunak was received by Union Minister Ashwini Choubey while Argentine President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez was welcomed by Union Minister Faggan Singh Kulaste.Comoros President Azali Assoumani also arrived here to a rousing welcome. He is also the chairperson of the African Union.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also arrived for the summit. On his arrival, Deputy Prime Minister of Oman Sayyid Fahd bin Mahmoud Al Said was received by Ashwini Choubey and he witnessed dance performance by cultural troupes.","source_domain":"worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev","text":null,"title":"PM Modi, US President Joe Biden hold bilateral talks ahead of G20 summit: Top developments","title_page":null,"title_rss":null,"url":"https://worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev/?url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-to-hold-15-bilateral-meetings-over-3-days-top-developments/articleshow/103514010.cms"},{"authors":["Timesofindia.Com"],"date_download":"2023-09-09 06:10:50","date_modify":"None","date_publish":"None","description":"India News: British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Friday said that no form of extremism or violence is acceptable in the UK and his government is working closely","filename":"https%3A%2F%2Fworker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Ftimesofindia.indiatimes.com%2Findia%2Fno-form-of-extremism-acceptablei-wont-tolerate-it-uk-pm-assures-india-on-concerns-about-activities-of-khalistani-elements%2Farticleshow%2F103512871.cms.json","graphId":"103512871.cms","image_url":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103512863,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-176846,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg","language":"en","localpath":null,"maintext":"NEW DELHI: British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Friday said that no form of extremism or violence is acceptable in the UK and his government is working closely with the Indian government to tackle pro-Khalistan extremism .Sunak while speaking to the news agency ANI said the two countries have working groups to share intelligence and information so that this kind of violent extremism can be rooted out.\"It's a really important question and let me just say unequivocally that no form of extremism or violence like that is acceptable in the UK.

It appears from cricketing points, that it was probably the players who didn't want to go to Hambantota.\"So administrators, had to at last moment, change it from Hambantota to Colombo despite knowing Colombo could have pretty dicey weather,\" Gavaskar told 'Sports Today'.But the former India captain clarified that he was not referring to players from any particular country.\"When I meant players, I didn't mean players of one team but players of all teams that were supposed to be there,\" he said.Gavaskar also sympathized with administrators as often they get the rough end of the stick from the fans, who are missing out on quality cricket due to inclement weather.\"It is easy to point fingers at administrators and they can be easily made scapegoats. It is really important to find out why despite knowing that weather forecast of Colombo won't be good, matches were not held in Hambantota,\" he said.Gavaskar is not averse to modern day players having a say in scheduling of matches but he also wants them to be accommodating when there are some unforseen circumstances, like poor weather in this case.Rain can also play spoilsport on September 10 when India are scheduled to face Pakistan for the second time in the tournament. The first game between the arch-rivals was called off due to rain.\"Obviously, you want players to be in good mental space. The gym facilities, practice facilities need to be good but at times like these, we need to look at the larger picture and Hambantota had less chance of rain and Colombo has more chance of rain.\"And when I say experimentation, it is a chance to prepare for the World Cup. But by no means I am saying that Asia Cup is less important. We also need to win the tournament,\" he said.","source_domain":"worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev","text":null,"title":"Sunil Gavaskar wants 'real story' behind Asia Cup venue fiasco","title_page":null,"title_rss":null,"url":"https://worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev/?url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/asia-cup/sunil-gavaskar-wants-real-story-behind-asia-cup-venue-fiasco/articleshow/103516840.cms"},{"authors":["Timesofindia.Com"],"date_download":"2023-09-09 06:10:52","date_modify":"None","date_publish":"None","description":"India Business News: US President Joe Biden, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Gulf leaders are planning to announce a joint infrastructure agreement during the G20","filename":"https%3A%2F%2Fworker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Ftimesofindia.indiatimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Findia-business%2Fg20-summit-india-us-gulf-states-may-sign-rail-port-deals%2Farticleshow%2F103491958.cms.json","graphId":"103491958.cms","image_url":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103492231,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1082799,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg","language":"en","localpath":null,"maintext":"NEW DELHI: US President Joe Biden , PM Modi and leaders of Gulf states are reportedly planning to announce a joint infrastructure agreement during the Group of 20 summit in Delhi this weekend.

It will also include connectivity to India through shipping lanes from ports in the region.These discussions align with the Biden administration's broader diplomatic efforts in the Middle East, which include encouraging Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel, Axios report said.Additionally, a US-supported proposal to expedite land-trade routes between Gulf Arab countries and the Mediterranean Sea has been discussed among Israel and Gulf nations. However, officials have acknowledged that there is no specific timeline for implementing these changes.Earlier this year, Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security advisor, held discussions in Saudi Arabia that involved Indian and UAE representatives. The talks explored potential areas of cooperation, including investments in strategic infrastructure projects such as ports and railways.According to Axios, an announcement of the project will likely increase the chances of a possible brief bilateral meeting between Biden and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on the sidelines of the G20 in Delhi.The American push comes as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, both old allies of US, have been strengthening their ties with China as they seek to enhance relations with rapidly growing eastern economies. Last month, these oil-rich Gulf states announced their intention to join the BRICS group of emerging market nations, with China playing a leading role in this move.The BRICS leaders are also working to increase the group's influence and counter US dominance in the global economy and trade, including the role of the US dollar.In recent years, the US has been actively countering President Xi Jinping 's Belt and Road Initiative, which has financed extensive infrastructure projects in emerging markets.

With numerous options available in the insurance market, it's essential to make an informed choice that suits your needs and budget.Here, we will provide you with some tips and suggestions to help you pick the right insurance for your car.Car insurance typically offers several types of coverage, including liability, collision, comprehensive, and uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage. Each type serves a different purpose. Third-party liability coverage pays for damages you cause to others and makes your vehicle legal to ply on roads, while collision and comprehensive coverages protect your own vehicle.The first step in selecting the right car insurance is to understand your needs. Consider factors such as the age and value of your car, your budget, and your driving habits. If you have a new, expensive vehicle, comprehensive coverage might be necessary. On the other hand, if you have an older car, third-party liability cover may be sufficient.Once you've determined your coverage needs, it's time to shop around. Obtain quotes from multiple insurance providers and check on the internet to compare prices and coverage options. Keep in mind that the cheapest policy may not always be the best, so consider the overall value and reputation of the insurance company.The deductible is the amount you pay out of pocket before your insurance kicks in. Higher deductibles generally result in lower premiums, but be sure you can afford the chosen deductible in case of an accident. Finding the right balance between deductible and premium is crucial.The claim settlement ratio (CSR) of the insurance company. This is the percentage of claims that the company has settled in a timely and fair manner. Also, inquire about the customer service of the insurance company. You want to be able to get help quickly and easily if you ever need to file a claim.Once you've considered all of these factors, you'll be able to choose the right car insurance for your needs and budget.","source_domain":"worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev","text":null,"title":"How to pick the right insurance for your car: Tips and suggestions","title_page":null,"title_rss":null,"url":"https://worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev/?url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/auto/advice-centre/how-to-pick-the-right-insurance-for-your-car-tips-and-suggestions/articleshow/103507321.cms"},{"authors":[],"date_download":"2023-09-09 06:10:52","date_modify":"None","date_publish":"None","description":"India News: The government has decided to support 75 lakh rural women associated with self help groups and related livelihood generating activities under the Deen","filename":"https%3A%2F%2Fworker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Ftimesofindia.indiatimes.com%2Findia%2Fgovt-to-support-75-lakh-women-in-shgs-become-lakhpati-didis-in-2023-24%2Farticleshow%2F103511017.cms.json","graphId":"103511017.cms","image_url":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103511034,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-2282826,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg","language":"en","localpath":null,"maintext":"NEW DELHI: The government has decided to support 75 lakh rural women associated with self help groups and related livelihood generating activities under the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihood Mission (DAY-NRLM) to become \u201clakhpati didis\u201d in the ongoing 2023-24 financial year by enabling them to earn at least Rs 1 lakh per annum.

Navalny, and a second man who Russian authorities said was caught trying to smuggle his young son out of the country.\nDetails of the two cases emerged earlier this week in Russian news media reports as well as in a statement from Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee, the country\u2019s main investigation agency. A State Department spokesman on Friday confirmed both arrests but declined to provide further details.\nIlya A. Startsev, 37, the English teacher, was among several people arrested in various cities in Russia on Wednesday and accused of donating money to Navalny\u2019s Anti-Corruption Foundation, which has been banned, according to OVD-Info, a rights group that reports on repression in Russia, as well as other Russian media outlets.\nThe foundation, known by its Russian initials F.B.K., has regularly embarrassed senior Russian officials, including President Vladimir V. Putin, by exposing vast holdings they have accumulated while in office, far beyond what their government paychecks would allow.\nThe other American was arrested after arriving in Russia on July 27 and accused of trying to kidnap his 4-year-old son, a Russian citizen, and to spirit him across the border into Poland, according to a statement released on Thursday by the Investigative Committee, which did not name the man.\nRegarding the teacher, the Russian government disbanded the Anti-Corruption Foundation in Russia in 2021 by declaring it an extremist organization, sending the group\u2019s main investigators fleeing into exile, where they continue to work. Various Navalny supporters have faced criminal charges in Russia as the Kremlin has ratcheted up repressive measures, especially those trying to silence critics of its war in Ukraine.\nA conviction for financing an extremist organization carries an eight-year jail sentence.\nMr. Startsev was born in Russia but moved to the United States as a child after his mother married an American, according to an interview he gave a few years ago as well as accounts in the Russian press. After moving to the Chicago area, he attended high school and Northern Illinois University, according to his online biography.\nHe moved back to Russia to pursue a teaching career. At the time of his arrest, he was teaching English for a Moscow company called the American Club of Education, which offers both online and in-person courses. He had also taught at a private school in Oryol, a provincial city more than 220 miles southwest of Moscow. He was jailed there on Thursday, a day after being detained in Moscow, Russian news media reports said.\nThere have been several recent cases of Americans being arrested on unlikely spying charges in Russia. Evan Gershkovich, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, is incarcerated in Moscow facing trial, and Paul Whelan, 53, a former Marine, is serving a 16-year sentence. Last December, Brittney Griner, an American basketball star imprisoned in Russia on drug charges, was released after nearly 10 months of captivity in a prisoner swap for Viktor Bout, a convicted Russian arms dealer known as the \u201cMerchant of Death,\u201d who is now running for office.\nOn social media, Mr. Startsev made no secret of his staunch support for Mr. Navalny, who survived what is widely considered an attempt by government agents to kill him with poison, and has since been jailed in a Russian penal colony on various charges that have extended his sentence to at least 19 years.\nIn his last writing on VKontakte, the Russian equivalent of Facebook, Mr. Startsev lauded Mr. Navalny\u2019s aims, and supported his vision of a \u201cfree, happy and uncorrupt future\u201d for Russia, he wrote, with virtuous politicians being a key to this.\nHe had also posted a picture of himself on VKontakte, holding up a poster of what appears to be an opposition rally in May 2018. The dense, hand-lettered poster called for fighting corruption, poverty and inequality; restoring free elections; giving the opposition access to the media; releasing political prisoners; ending government control of the internet; and allowing the freedom of assembly.\nIn his 2019 interview, Mr. Startsev said he had used his time in the United States to improve his credentials in order to get a better job back in Russia. Asked about life in the United States, he said, \u201cThe food there has a different taste; the air is cleaner; the roads are better.\u201d\nHe had learned a lot, Mr. Startsev said, but he wanted to apply it in Russia: \u201cI want to help Russia become a great and beautiful country.\u201d\nIn the other case, the Russian authorities are accusing the man of trying to take his son to live outside Russia without obtaining consent from the child\u2019s mother, the office of the Investigative Committee in Kaliningrad said in the statement released on its Telegram channel. A criminal investigation has been started but no charges filed yet pending the man being questioned further, the statement said.\nAfter arriving in Russia on July 27, the American met his son, who is a Russian citizen, the committee said. The boy lived in Kaliningrad, which borders the Baltic Sea and is Russia\u2019s farthest point west. \u201cUnder the pretext of spending time together,\u201d the man drove the boy in a car to a town near the Polish border and was detained while trying to cross it by walking through a swampy, wooded area, the statement said.\nAt the time of the incident, a court in Kaliningrad had been weighing where the boy should live, the statement said.\nMilana Mazaeva contributed reporting.","source_domain":"worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev","text":null,"title":"Zelensky Says Future of War in Ukraine Hinges on U.S. Presidential Election","title_page":null,"title_rss":null,"url":"https://worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev/?url=https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/09/08/world/russia-ukraine-news"},{"authors":["Katie Rogers","Peter Baker","More About Katie Rogers","More About Peter Baker"],"date_download":"2023-09-09 06:10:56","date_modify":"None","date_publish":"2023-09-08 09:02:28","description":"With the Russian and Chinese leaders absent, the president hopes to get others to align with him on a variety of matters, including Ukraine and curbing Beijing\u2019s assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific.","filename":"https%3A%2F%2Fworker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2023%2F09%2F08%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Fbiden-g20.html.json","graphId":"biden-g20.html","image_url":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/08/multimedia/08dc-biden-g20-pbqz/08dc-biden-g20-pbqz-facebookJumbo.jpg","language":"en","localpath":null,"maintext":"The president plans to use the trip to shore up his relationship with the G20 host, Mr. Modi, who is using the economic-focused meeting to showcase the promise and potential of a juggernaut Indian economy.

For well over a millennium, Jews were subjected to forced conversion, expulsion, censorship, mass murder by roving Christian mobs and life in ghettos. And that was all before the Inquisition got going.\nIn 1964, Pope Paul VI became the first pope to visit Israel, and in 1965, the church issued the Latin document \u201cNostra Aetate,\u201d or \u201cIn Our Times,\u201d which deplored antisemitism and said Jews could not collectively be blamed for the death of Jesus. In 2000, Pope John Paul II offered a sweeping apology for the mistreatment of Jews by Catholics, though he did not specifically apologize for the role of the church leadership in the gravest crimes, including the Holocaust.\nIn 2019, Pope Francis ordered the archives of Pius opened, saying, \u201cThe church is not afraid of history.\u201d Initial evidence from those archives painted a picture of Pius as a pope whose fear of Communism, belief that the Axis powers would win the war and desire to protect the church\u2019s interests and avoid alienating millions of German, and Nazi-sympathizing, Catholics, all motivated him to avoid confronting or offending Hitler.\nDavid Kertzer, a Brown University professor who dug up some of that evidence and who has written several books on the popes of the early 20th century, said in a telephone interview that it was \u201cquite clear\u201d to historians that Pius XII \u201cnever called on the Catholic institutions in Rome to shelter Jews during the German occupation and, while he was aware that it was happening,\u201d he was \u201cquite nervous about it, not wanting to antagonize the German authorities.\u201d\nPius \u201ccertainly did not want Jews concealed in Vatican City, and very few were,\u201d he added.\nDefenders of Pius XII, whose case for sainthood is still being evaluated, have long argued that he worked behind the scenes to help Jews. They have chalked up criticism of him to anti-Catholic animus. Other scholars say it will take years to plumb papers referring to Pius and paint a full picture of his papacy.","source_domain":"worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev","text":null,"title":"Researchers Identify Jews Aided by Catholics in Nazi Era as Pope Was Silent","title_page":null,"title_rss":null,"url":"https://worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev/?url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/07/world/europe/world-war-2-pius-jews.html"},{"authors":["The New York Times"],"date_download":"2023-09-09 06:11:01","date_modify":"None","date_publish":"2023-09-07 17:14:41","description":"Sign up to watch the livestream and connect with online attendees about solutions to the climate crisis on Thursday, Sept. 21.","filename":"https%3A%2F%2Fworker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2023%2F09%2F07%2Fclimate%2Fclimate-forward-event.html.json","graphId":"climate-forward-event.html","image_url":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/07/climate/07CF-Event-main/07CF-Event-main-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg","language":"en","localpath":null,"maintext":"Climate change is an issue that stretches across borders, touching every facet of our lives.

But the island\u2019s tourism industry is cyclical and vulnerable to external shocks, including the 2002 Bali bombing, the 2017 eruption of the Mount Agung volcano and the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe jobs can be risky, too. Some of Bali\u2019s workers have full-time contracts that make them eligible for government employment insurance \u2014 a perk that includes pension benefits and a payout equivalent to 48 times a worker\u2019s monthly salary if he or she dies on the job. Others, like four of the five young housekeepers who died in the elevator accident last week, are day laborers or contractors who work without a social safety net, sometimes for years.\nSome of the Bali resorts that employ staff as long-term day laborers or contractors are large and prosperous enough to pay their foreign staff salaries of $5,000 or $6,000 a month, said Niluh Djelantik, an entrepreneur on the island.\n\u201cThey think they can get away with it because nobody will find out,\u201d she said.\nIn the Ayuterra Resort case, the government insurance agency decided to give all five workers insurance payouts of over $10,000. But such charity is rare. And even though the resort gave each of the victims\u2019 families more than $2,600 each, mostly for funeral expenses, it reportedly did so only after requiring them to sign an agreement promising not to sue.\nRepresentatives for Ayuterra Resort, in the Ubud area of Bali, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The resort\u2019s website advertises what it calls a \u201cback to nature\u201d guest experience that includes glass-lined bedrooms and views of a forest, a mountain and a river.

She spent tedious hours in government offices helping newcomers with paperwork, and worked at the women\u2019s shelter that her sister Louise co-founded.\nHer other world was the bohemian scene that sprawled across the city\u2019s cheap apartments, squats, cafes and screening rooms, where she joined the era\u2019s interminable debates over philosophy and art. \u201cIt was a flux moment,\u201d she said of the 1990s in Berlin, \u201cwhen things were changing and unstable in a positive way.\u201d","source_domain":"worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev","text":null,"title":"A Sculptor Breaks Through, Taking the Walls Down With Her","title_page":null,"title_rss":null,"url":"https://worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev/?url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/06/arts/design/nairy-baghramian-met-facade-nyc-sculpture.html"},{"authors":["Andrew E.

And that has had profound consequences not just for organized crime, but for the development of the Mexican state itself.\n\u2018Criminal state-building\u2019\n\u201cThere really is no binary between the \u2018bad\u2019 cartels and the \u2018good\u2019 state,\u201d said Alexander Avi\u00f1a, an Arizona State historian who studies the drug trade in Mexico. \u201cI think those of us who work on the history of drugs in 20th-century Mexico will say that drug trafficking actually emerges within the confines of the Mexican state, particularly the long running PRI party that was in power from 1949 to 2000.\u201d\nIn the popular imagination, collaboration between cartels and state officials tends to take the form of corruption: criminals pay bribes to officials, who then tolerate drug trafficking in exchange for private wealth. But that story doesn\u2019t quite fit Mexico, said Benjamin T. Smith, a professor at Warwick University in the U.K., and the author of a book on the history of the Mexican drug trade.\nRather, he said, there is a long history of Mexican officials taking money from drug traffickers to fund the government, not just personal bribes. He described it as a kind of \u201ccriminal state-building.\u201d But that state-building later proved to be dangerously fragile.\nDocuments from the 1940s show that police in the state of Sinaloa, for instance, were extorting money from opium growers, Smith said.

The number of sightings, confirmed when specimens have been analyzed in a laboratory, is up from two last year, two in 2021 and one in 2020, according to British government statistics. The hornet, which is native to parts of Asia, was first detected in Britain in 2016, and its activity peaks in August and September.\nIt is distinct from the world\u2019s largest hornet, Vespa mandarinia, which has been referred to as the \u201cAsian giant hornet\u201d or \u201cmurder hornet,\u201d and was found in the Pacific Northwest of the United States in 2019.\nSmaller than Britain\u2019s native hornet, most Asian hornets are about an inch long and have brown thoraxes, yellow legs and black heads with orange faces. The species was first recorded in France in 2005 and is thought to have arrived in a container of pottery from China, according to the Non-Native Species Secretariat, a British organization that coordinates responses to invasive species. Since arriving in France, the population of Asian hornets has grown rapidly. As of last year, the hornets have been seen in European countries including Germany, Spain, Portugal and Italy, according to the National Bee Unit, a British agency.","source_domain":"worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev","text":null,"title":"British Bees Face a Deadly Invasion","title_page":null,"title_rss":null,"url":"https://worker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev/?url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/06/world/europe/asian-hornet-bees-uk.html"},{"authors":["Emma Bubola","More About Emma Bubola"],"date_download":"2023-09-09 06:11:10","date_modify":"None","date_publish":"2023-09-06 10:37:49","description":"Air traffic computer systems shut down after receiving duplicate data, a report found, forcing plans to be processed manually.","filename":"https%3A%2F%2Fworker-billowing-sun-2f5d.belos51236.workers.dev%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2023%2F09%2F06%2Fworld%2Feurope%2Fuk-flights-air-traffic-control-chaos.html.json","graphId":"uk-flights-air-traffic-control-chaos.html","image_url":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/06/multimedia/06uk-flights-bhkp/06uk-flights-bhkp-facebookJumbo.jpg","language":"en","localpath":null,"maintext":"The technical failure that led to hundreds of flight cancellations and severe disruptions for thousands of people traveling in and out of Britain last week resulted from a \u201cone in 15 million chance,\u201d the country\u2019s air traffic control service said on Wednesday.\n\u201cWe have processed 15 million flight plans with this system,\u201d Martin Rolfe, the chief executive of Britain\u2019s National Air Traffic Service, told the BBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d program.
